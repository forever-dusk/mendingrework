Mod Feature List:
- Repairing items in anvils costs 0 experience and does not increase future combine costs.
- Chance of anvil taking damage on use reduced by half.
- Mending enchant no longer repairs items with experience.
- Items with mending regain more durability when repaired and will never damage an anvil when renaming or repairing.
- Unbreaking enchant uses the same formula on armor as on items (armor will last longer).
- Netherite items are repaired with diamonds or netherite scraps instead of netherite ingots.
- Tridents are repaired with diamonds, crossbows with iron, bows and fishing rods with string.
- If an item doesn't have a set repair material it defaults to Bottle O' Enchanting.
